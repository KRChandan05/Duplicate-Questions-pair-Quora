# __Duplicate-Questions-pair-Quora__

## __Dataset__ : [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs/data]
### Quora is a general-purpose Q&A platform
### One of the many problems that quora face is the duplication of questions. Duplication of question ruins the experience for both the questioner and the answerer. Since the questioner is asking a duplicate question, we can just show him/her the answers to the previous question. And the answerer doesnâ€™t have to repeat his/her answer for essentially the same questions.
